      "gameDetailText":"Overwatch (retroactively referred to as Overwatch 1[b]) was a 2016 team-based
       multiplayer first-person shooter game by Blizzard Entertainment. The game was first released for PlayStation 4,
      Windows, and Xbox One in May 2016 and Nintendo Switch in October 2019.
       Cross-platform play was supported across all platforms.
      Described as a hero shooter, Overwatch assigned players into two teams of six, 
      with each player selecting from a large roster of characters, known as heroes,
      with unique abilities. Teams worked to complete map-specific objectives within a limited period of time. 
      Blizzard added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, all free of charge, 
      with the only additional cost to players being optional loot boxes to purchase cosmetic items."
